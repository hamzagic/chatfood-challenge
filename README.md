# chatfood-app

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

#### Observations:
Keep the browser console open when running the application. When clicking on a dish name, it will be added to the local storage until it reaches the stock availability.
If a dish has reached it, an "Item unavailable" message will display on the console.
Keep checking the localStorage to get its status.

The current project follows the requirements from https://gist.github.com/bissolli/89b53bf48b84d0c1c68fddba51ba85ac
